# React Native Demo App

## Architecture
This project is using MVVM + Redux Architecture

#### [React Native with MVVM](https://www.expertappdevs.com/blog/react-native-with-mvvm)

#### [Clean MVVM with React and React Hooks](https://paulallies.medium.com/clean-mvvm-with-react-and-react-hooks-ebc37b22542f)

## Dependencies

#### [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write [Redux](https://redux.js.org) logic.

#### [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
Axios allows us to communicate with APIs easily in our React apps. Though this can also be achieved by other methods like fetch or AJAX, Axios can provide a little more functionality that goes a long way with applications that use React.

#### [MMKV Storage](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv)
MMKV is an efficient, small mobile key-value storage framework developed by WeChat. See Tencent/MMKV for more information

react-native-mmkv is a library that allows you to easily use MMKV inside your React Native applications. It provides fast and direct bindings to the native C++ library which are accessible through a simple JS API.

## Dev Dependencies

#### [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
Husky improves your commits and more üê∂ woof!
You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports all Git hooks.

#### [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.

#### [Mirage JS](https://miragejs.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
Mirage is a JavaScript library that lets frontend developers mock out backend APIs.
Unlike other mocking libraries, Mirage makes it easy to recreate dynamic scenarios, the kind that are typically only possible when using a real production server.

#### [Faker JS](https://github.com/faker-js/faker)
Generate massive amounts of fake (but realistic) data for testing and development.

#### [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver)
A Babel plugin to add a new resolver for your modules when compiling your code using Babel. This plugin allows you to add new "root" directories that contain your modules. It also allows you to setup a custom alias for directories, specific files, or even other npm modules.
